 Firm Information 

Reed Smith is a global relationship law firm with more than 1,700 lawyers in 30 offices throughout the United States, Europe, Asia and the Middle East.

Founded in 1877, the firm represents leading international businesses, from Fortune 100 corporations to mid-market and emerging enterprises.

For more information, visit reedsmith.com.

 Position Summary 

The preferred offices for this position are New York, Washington DC, Pittsburgh, Chicago and Philadelphia

Reed Smith is seeking a Senior Manager, Head of Strategic Insights to play a critical role in translating complex data analysis into meaningful and actionable insights for our firm's leadership. This role is not about dashboarding – we already have a significant data collection, a broad team of analysts, and plenty of great dashboards. This position will act as a trusted advisor to senior leadership, guiding and empowering them to understand, interpret, and act upon key insights from our data collection to enhance firm performance, drive growth, and deliver superior client outcomes. The role is as broad as the range of insights, which include identifying special intelligence across client, financial, pipeline, market, risk, competitive, pricing, talent, and other aspects of tuning a global legal practice.

The role must also bridge between leadership and our Intelligence and AI analysts. To curate the most impactful insights, these technical and data teams must be assembling, growing, enhancing, and correlating our data with these outcomes in mind.

Reporting to the Director of Intelligence, the Senior Manager, Head of Strategic Insights will play a pivotal role in shaping the firm's future by championing a culture of innovation and continuous improvement.

Context For Strategic Insights

Reed Smith has committed to an extended program of re-examining how it approaches traditional business operations and the provision of legal services. The firm is creating a common global platform that provides its lawyers and clients with a competitive edge, in terms of intelligence, learning, collaboration, efficiencies, and risk management. The firm has completed an initial foundational phase which included the provision of 22 new or improved business systems, the expansion of the firm’s data framework to over 8 billion elements, and ongoing piloting of key Generative AI systems. The firm invested in a data analytics COE, expanded programs in Client Value and Strategic Resourcing, and recently hired a Director of Applied AI.

But these elements are means to an end. To prepare to evolve the DNA of the firm, the firm created the Innovation Lab in 2022 headed by a PhD Anthropologist, utilizing human centered design and client feedback in creating fresh playbooks. In alignment with senior partners, the firm identified four key practices to serve as long term proofs of concepts for these collective changes as well as fresh considerations of incentives, mentoring, and value. Our objectives aren’t simply to use tech better, but to grow our pipelines, understand and predict our clients’ needs more deeply, be leaders in collaboration despite our global footprint, and optimize our efficiency along the way. As we prove and tune our results through key practices, we will grow to impact more of the firm overall.

Thus, insights from our data have become critical to our work. Our expectations for what our leaders should understand are as broad as the ever-expanding volumes of data available to them. We have to cut through the noise, predict the future, and keep attention on the most important issues.

Team

Reporting to this role is a small although experienced team of business and data insight analysts. This role is a senior member of our Intelligence team, which also currently includes team members focused on CRM administration, data quality, data analysis, and reporting. As beneficial, we also contract skills with particular areas of expertise, notably vendors to develop data science solutions and to implement vendor-created software systems. There are also complementary resources around the firm including our Innovation Lab, Applied AI, Change Leadership, Learning & Development, IT Transformation, and the Innovation and Strategy Committee.

Essential Functions 

 With Intelligence teams: Gain a thorough understanding of existing analyses across all areas of the firm, including financial, client, talent, and competitive intelligence.  Seek to understand what existing analysis should mean to leadership and what stories it does not yet reveal.  Ensure the Insights team becomes experts in sources of intelligence, whether structured or unstructured, internal or external, established or emerging, explicit or tacit.  Guide the roadmap of data acquisition and data quality work based on the stories that need to be learned and told.  Guide the analyst and technical roles on the Intelligence teams on how to tune analysis, perform new investigations, seek patterns, improve depth, identify new sources of data, or otherwise push further into learning from our data assets.  Evaluate, challenge, tune, and lead user testing of new areas of analysis and insights to continuously improve depth, usefulness, and uniqueness.  Stay informed about emerging trends, best practices, and advancements in data analytics and strategic planning, and recommend innovative approaches to enhance the firm's data capabilities and competitive advantage.  With firm leadership: Collaborate closely with firm leadership to identify key business questions and objectives that can be addressed through data analysis and insights.  Partner with practice group leaders, department heads, and other stakeholders to assess data needs, define performance metrics, and develop actionable insights tailored to specific business areas.  Support the development and implementation of a strategic framework for leveraging data to inform decision-making and drive operational excellence across the firm.  Design and deliver presentations and reports that communicate data-driven insights in a clear, concise, and compelling manner to facilitate understanding and decision-making at all levels of the organization.  Serve as a subject matter expert on data-related topics, providing training, coaching, and resources to equip leadership with the knowledge and skills needed to effectively leverage data in their roles.  Collaborate with cross-functional teams, including our Financial Intelligence Unit, IT, and Marketing, to integrate data insights into broader business strategies and initiatives. 
Job functions included are not exhaustive and may be supplemented as necessary. Reed Smith reserves the right to revise or modify job functions at any time.

Background MGS is currently working on a project for the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE), Water Resource Division (WRD) in response to state-wide PFAS contamination concerns.

These issues gave rise to the grant-funded MGS Triage project. The primary goal of the Triage project is to validate and bolster the existing Wellogic water well database-- that can support generating more accurate and reliable water resource data including hydrogeologic maps for all the state programs, consultants and stakeholders.

Republic Services, Inc. (NYSE: RSG) is a leader in the environmental services industry. We provide customers with the most complete set of products and services, including recycling, waste, special waste, hazardous waste and field services. Our industry-leading commitments to advance circularity and support decarbonization are helping deliver on our vision to partner with customers to create a more sustainable world.

In 2023, Republic’s total company revenue was $14.9 billion, and adjusted EBITDA was $4.4 billion. We serve 13 million customers and operate more than 1,000 locations, including collection and transfer stations, recycling and polymer centers, treatment facilities, and landfills.

Although we operate across North America, the collection, recycling, treatment, or disposal of materials is a local business, and the dynamics and opportunities differ in each market we serve. By combining local operational management with standardized business practices, we drive greater operating efficiencies across the company while maintaining day-to-day operational decisions at the local level, closest to the customer.

Our customers, including small businesses, major corporations and municipalities, want a partner with the expertise and capabilities to effectively manage their multiple recycling and waste streams. They choose Republic Services because we are committed to exceeding their expectations and helping them achieve their sustainability goals. Our 41,000 team members understand that it's not just what we do that matters, but how we do it.

Our Company Values Guide Our Daily Actions

Safe: We protect the livelihoods of our colleagues and communities.Committed to Serve: We go above and beyond to exceed our customers’ expectations.Environmentally Responsible: We take action to improve our environment.Driven: We deliver results in the right way.Human-Centered: We respect the dignity and unique potential of every person.

In addition, our team positively impacted 4.6 million people in 2023 through the Republic Services Charitable Foundation and local community grants. These projects are designed to meet the specific needs of the communities we serve, with a focus on building sustainable neighborhoods.

STRATEGY

Republic Services’ strategy is designed to generate profitable growth. Through acquisitions and industry advancements, we safely and sustainably manage our customers’ multiple waste streams through a North American footprint of vertically integrated assets.

We focus on three areas of growth to meet the increasing needs of our customers: recycling and waste, environmental solutions and sustainability innovation.

With our integrated approach, strengthening our position in one area advances other areas of our business. For example, as we grow volume in recycling and waste, we collect additional material to bolster our circularity capabilities. And as we expand environmental solutions, we drive additional opportunities to provide these services to our existing recycling and waste customers.

Recycling and Waste

We continue to expand our recycling and waste business footprint throughout North America through organic growth and targeted acquisitions. The 13 million customers we serve and our more than 5 million pick-ups per day provide us with a distinct advantage. We aggregate materials at scale, unlocking new opportunities for advanced recycling. In addition, we are cross-selling new products and services to better meet our customers’ specific needs.

Environmental Solutions

Our comprehensive environmental solutions capabilities help customers safely manage their most technical waste streams. We are expanding both our capabilities and our geographic footprint. We see strong growth opportunities for our offerings, including PFAS remediation, an increasing customer need.

SUSTAINABILITY INNOVATION

Republic’s recent innovations to advance circularity and decarbonization demonstrate our unique ability to leverage sustainability as a platform for growth.

The Republic Services Polymer Center is the nation’s first integrated plastics recycling facility. This innovative site processes rigid plastics from our recycling centers, producing recycled materials that promote true bottle-to-bottle circularity. We also formed Blue Polymers, a joint venture with Ravago, to develop facilities that will further process plastic material from our Polymer Centers to help meet the growing demand for sustainable packaging. We are building a network of Polymer Centers and Blue Polymer facilities across North America.

We continue to advance decarbonization at our landfills. As demand for renewable energy continues to grow, we have 70 landfill gas-to-energy projects in operation and plan to expand our portfolio to 115 projects by 2028.
